<h1>Past comedy work</h1>
<p>Most of my work samples are in comedy, where I spent the longest part of my career and did the most under my own name - it doesn't relate too cleanly to my ghostwriting work, but it's what I've been doing. </p>
<p>Here are a few interesting projects still worth sharing:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theonion.com/college-basketball-star-heroically-overcomes-tragic-rap-1819594970">"College Basketball Star Heroically Overcomes Tragic Rape He Committed" - this was a segment I wrote for <em>The Onion SportsDome</em>, a TV show that aired on Comedy Central, and got some notoriety a few years later <a href="https://www.gawker.com/5991175/this-two-year-old-onion-story-perfectly-predicted-cnns-shocking-steubenville-rape-trial-coverage">when the media response to a real-life case</a> seemed to echo it. I can cite it because a co-worker publicly outed me as the author - typically Onion pieces aren't individually credited.</p>
	<p> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-499994158">Robert Orben's Monday Joke book</a>, a silly podcast breaking down a dated joke book with some friends. The production is very haphazard, and my solo segments were weak, but the core is pretty fun and works well. With better editing, an actual budget, and more experience, this could be really fun</p>
<p>In addition to doing a lot of group writing for Funny or Die, I briefly had a personal column, "David Has Been Thinking," during the era when the site was running written content. This was my  <a href="https://funnyordie.com/2014/10/24/69310/the-need-to-urinate-in-bathrooms-is-evidence-of-the-tyranny-of-civilization/">favorite of the installments</a>. </p>
<p>I wrote and staged a play at the <a href="https://www.theannoyance.com/">Annoyance Theater </a> that was very /"NSFW/", which I will absolutely not be posting online, but which you are free to ask about. It was tons of fun. In summary I can work clean for hire, often do, but don't <em>have</em> to.</p> 
<p>I've written several pilot scripts that I will eventually rework, but am glad to send in their intermediate form to interested parties./p>
